			<h1>About</h1>
		</header>
	<p> I have a thirst for knowledge and am learning more about
	how to code daily. I am excited to learn more languages and everything I
	can about web development. I truly have a passion for code and it's just something
	that I love doing as my career. I have built several websites and it gives me a
	feeling of great accomplishment when I see how happy the customers are with their finished product. I want to
	take my experience and knowledge to a team to create and maintain some truly dynamic websites and web
	applications. Although I may be a front-end Web Developer at the moment, I strive to be a full-stack developer
		eventually.
		</p><br>
	<p>
	Last year I attended the LambdaConf 2015 conference in Boulder, Colorado which allowed me to be introduced to several
	other languages and frameworks, such as: Elm, PureScript, Clojure/ClojureScript, Haskell, Rust and many
	other concepts of functional programming.

	I also attended Develop Denver which is another conference on various programming languages along with classes on design and data.
	</p><br>
	<p>
		I have also started working on some non-profit projects through Code For Denver where we work as a team and
		collaborate on how to get the project done. With each team member having experience in various languages and
		frameworks, we can all give our input and expertise to create something truly awesome. The main project I have been working on with Code for Denver is for the City of Denver. It's an energy sustainability project showing the buildings in Denver and whether they have an Energy Star Score rating if they are over 50,000 square feet. Here is the beta version of that project here: <a href="http://denver-sustainability.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Denver Sustainability</a>
